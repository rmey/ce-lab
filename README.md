# Welcome to our IBM Cloud Code Engine Workshop

In this tutorial, you will learn about IBM Cloudâ„¢ Code Engine by deploying a text analysis with Natural Language Understanding application. You will create a Code Engine project, select the project and deploy Code Engine entities - applications and jobs - to the project. You will learn how to bind IBM Cloud services to your Code Engine entities. You will also understand the auto-scaling capability of Code Engine where instances are scaled up or down \(to zero\) based on incoming workload. This is a simplified version of the IBM Cloud Solution Tutorial for Code Engine.
